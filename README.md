# SLKCAN_Sandbox
Sandbox Arduino ESP32 sketch for SLKCAN board. Sharing my existing logic hacking and testing. 

General Goals:
- Test Functionality of the SLKCAN board(s). 
- Provide a method to stream data from the CAN library for logging purposes. To help with decoding the CANBus messages. 
- Eventually have SD card logging support. Waiting on SLKCAN01 boards for this.
- Test Bluetooth support. In particular the ability to transmit data to a smartphone. 
- Test parsing data from known CANbus messages
- Provide a general basis for anyone using the board to get started on their own.
